# 6. Preserving Education in the Summer and If Schools Stay Closed

## 6.1 Wifi and online education

A major concern is to provide opportunities for pupils in state schools
who may not have access to wifi, computers, tablets or smartphones if
education is forced to move largely online. In a digital world we
believe every child in school aged seven and above should have access to
these facilities. Options for requisitioning independent schools,
academy schools, church halls, sports clubs, football stadiums and other
facilities should be considered to provide socially distanced facilities
for all children.

We must also support children from families who find home schooling
difficult for other reasons (such as not having English as a first
language).

## 6.2 Summer camps and open-air education

Local authorities and civil society groups should be mobilised to
provide **summer schools and camps** to help with educational “catch
up”, particularly for those most disadvantaged by the lockdown, and
also to provide some respite for parents and carers. This presents a
major opportunity for community engagement and potentially the use of
some of the 750,000 volunteers.

Use of sports grounds, football, rugby and other stadia and hire of
marquees will provide opportunities for exercise and socially distanced
education for children. If teachers are not available, trained coaches
and approved supervisors would be needed for these activities including
music and drama.

Governments have a duty to provide the **investment and resources** for
schools and staff, for reduced class sizes, and, where schools do not
open or open partially, to take steps to provide alternatives to ensure
meaningful education that meets the needs of all children *.*  

## 6.3 Hidden hunger

We remain concerned about the level of hidden hunger among children from
poorer households, with parents who are on benefits or in low-paid
employment. According to **[UNICEF](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/IWP_2017_09.pdf)**, in 2017, 10% of children in the UK were living in households affected by
severe food insecurity. According to [](http://endhungeruk.org/shocking-figures-showing-hidden-hunger-show-need-find/)
**[figures](http://endhungeruk.org/shocking-figures-showing-hidden-hunger-show-need-find/)**
published by [](http://endhungeruk.org/) **[End Hunger
UK](http://endhungeruk.org/)**, in January 2018 16% of adults in Great
Britain either skipped or saw someone else in their household skip
meals; 14% of adults worried about not having enough food to eat; and 8%
of adults had gone a whole day without eating because of a lack of money
during the last 12 months.

Provision of midday meals for vulnerable children out of school and
during the summer months is essential, supported by government, local
authorities or via civil society organisations.

## 6.4 WHO Check Lists

We suggest that schools consider using the checklists for parents and
children and for students as suggested by the Word Health Organisation
regarding Actions for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Schools. [See
Appendix 3](report/chapter_7?id=_3-who-checklists).

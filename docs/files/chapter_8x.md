## What is the Independent SAGE?

‘We are following the ​science’ is the message the British public have
been hearing from government since COVID-19 mitigating measures began.
It says it is following the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for
Emergencies (SAGE). But the activities of the committee have been kept
secret and excluded from scrutiny by the public or wider scientific
community.

In response, on Monday May 4, the Independent SAGE convened as a group
of preeminent experts from the UK and around the world. The aim of the
Independent SAGE was and is to provide robust, independent advice to HM
Government with the purpose of helping the UK navigate COVID-19 whilst
minimising fatalities.

The Independent SAGE is chaired by former HM Government Chief Scientific
Advisor Sir David King and draws on a range of international and British
experts.

### What did the Independent SAGE discuss?

The Independent SAGE i​nvestigated seven key poi​nts to make
constructive recommendations to support the government’s handling of the
coronavirus pandemic in the UK:

1.  What are the criteria for lifting lockdown?

2.  How can testing and tracing be successfully achieved?

3.  Are the policies on quarantine and the shielding of vulnerable
    groups sufficient?

4.  What social distancing policies will be required in the future? In
    particular, on school closures and public gatherings

5.  What port and border controls are required?

6.  Where does responsibility lie for managing the pandemic? Are all
    levels of government being utilised effectively, is the response by
    central government delivered vertically failing?

7.  The UK has enormous globally recognised untapped resources that
    should be called on, such as the Royal Society and Academies,
    manufacturers, etc. How do we bring these into the picture much more
    effectively? Will we manufacture the vaccines we and the world needs
    in the UK?

In response to these questions, the Independent SAGE assessed measures
to date, asked whether the strategy has been effective to date and
reviewed what approached they believed should be adopted to minimise
deaths, ending the pandemic as soon as possible.

The approach of the committee is to provide a set of recommendations
from this first meeting. It will be based on minimising deaths and
ending the epidemic as soon as possible.

### What will the outcomes be?

The Independent SAGE will provide a series of evidence-based
recommendations for the UK government based on global best practice.

### What is the format?

The Independent SAGE will engage in an open debate on the topics on the
agenda. This evidence session was live streamed
on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqwC56XTP8F9zeEUCOttPQ/featured) so
the public can see the evidence presented and understand the debate
within the scientific community on the most appropriate course of action
for the UK government.

### The Independent SAGE Behavioural Advisory Group

A new Behavioural Advisory Group has been formed to contribute to the
discussions, advice and papers of Independent SAGE.

The formation of the group recognises the central role of the
behavioural and social sciences in the response to Covid-19. Every
measure to counter the spread of infection is dependent upon the
understanding, engagement and adherence to guidance of the public,
whether that be self-isolating, social distancing, practising
self-protective behaviours such as hand cleansing, getting tested or
(eventually) getting vaccinated.

In order to gain the adherence of the public to pandemic control
measures, it is critical that the authorities are trusted. For this to
happen, both central and local authorities must involve all sections of
the public as partners in all stages of the development, delivery and
assessment of policies.

Equally, it is crucial to consider the impact of every policy and
practice on practices on all sections of the public, especially those
who are most vulnerable, with a view to reducing inequalities. Diversity
is central to the thinking, procedures and membership of our new group.

Our focus, however, is not limited to the behaviour of the public. We
will also address that of policy-makers, planners, and health and social
care workers. They are all part of a complex system of people and
organisations needed to address the problem. Getting the right policies
involves understanding the capability, opportunity and motivations of
people in all parts of society.

The Independent SAGE Behavioural Advisory Group includes leading
authorities in anthropology, behavioural sciences, criminology, health
studies and psychology. Some of the members also participate in UK-wide
and Scottish government advisory groups. Its role is complementary, not
an alternative, to these other roles. It will support Independent SAGE
in looking in depth at key policy issues, including ones not currently
on the government’s agenda.

The Behavioural Advisory Group aims to help in the development of
constructive proposals and policies that will help the UK Government
lead the country out of the worst public health crisis of our
lifetime.
